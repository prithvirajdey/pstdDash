Realtime Streaming Dashboard using:
 - RethinkDB
 - Horizon.io
 - Angular 2


 What your code is designed for
It is designed for building up a realtime streaming dashboard for the users. The demand for stream processing is increasing a lot these days. The reason is that often processing big volumes of data is not enough.

Data has to be processed fast, so that a firm can react to changing business conditions in real time. At this moment Big data is a buzzword which comes with three V's Volume, Velocity and Variety. This huge data posses a challenge of fast processing of data. JARVIS has the solution for both of these business problems through the technologies it uses. Jarvis is built up on a backend server Rethinkdb and Node.js, Javascript client library and Horizon.

What your code was written in 
A backend server built with Node.js and RethinkDB that supports data persistence, realtime streams, input validation, user authentication, and permissions
A JavaScript client library that developers can use on the frontend to store JSON documents in the database, perform queries, and subscribe to live updates
A command-line tool that can generate project templates, start up a local Horizon development server, and help you deploy your Horizon application to the cloud
Horizon is an open source software which will watch for change feeds or live updates in Rethinkdb and push it to the front end. It eliminates repetitive boilerplate and tedious steps like hand-writing CRUD endpoints, authentication, and session management.
